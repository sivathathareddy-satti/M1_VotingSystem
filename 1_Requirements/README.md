## Project Name: M1_Voting System
* In this project, we make a voting machine in which we have 4 different option to vote each user vote one time and after all the user gives their vote we will conclude   the result and store in our file and we have a full-fledged file in which we store a list of winner party for every year.

* 1.counting the total number of votes cast																														
* 2.calculating the percentage of total votes
* 3.calculating the total votes cast for each candidate
* 4.calculating the percentage of votes for each candidate
* 5.checking duplication and error in voting
* 6.finding the wining candidates in the election based on the total votes they received.
***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
## Modules Used:

* Keeping the election and voting requirements in mind, Online Voting System has been developed with two modules: administrator module and user module.

* Administrator has the whole authority over the system; they maintain (add, update, modify and delete) records and details of all voters and candidates. 
* Users, on the other hand, can view the list of voters and candidates, and see results after the election is completed.
