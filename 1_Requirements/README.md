##Modules Used:

Keeping the election and voting requirements in mind, Online Voting System has been developed with two modules: administrator module and user module.

Administrator has the whole authority over the system; they maintain (add, update, modify and delete) records and details of all voters and candidates. 
Users, on the other hand, can view the list of voters and candidates, and see results after the election is completed.
